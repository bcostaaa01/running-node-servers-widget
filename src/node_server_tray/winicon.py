"""A pystray Icon where *any* click opens the dashboard directly.

Stock pystray only auto-invokes the menu's default item on a **left**
click; a right click always pops its plain, unstylable native menu, which
means an extra "click to open" step. Native Windows tray flyouts (network,
volume, battery, OneDrive) don't work that way -- one click, either button,
shows the panel -- so we reach into pystray's private Win32 message handler
to match that.

This depends on pystray internals (``_on_notify``, ``pystray._util.win32``)
that could change between releases; if the import shape moves, we fall back
to stock pystray.Icon (right click shows its native menu) instead of
crashing.
